## üîÑ Difference Between OLTP and OLAP

### üîπ What is OLTP?

**OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)** is used for managing **day-to-day operations**. It supports a high volume of short, simple transactions.

* **Examples**: ATM withdrawals, placing an order, booking a ticket.

### üîπ What is OLAP?

**OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)** is used for **data analysis**, reporting, and trend evaluation. It supports complex queries over large amounts of historical data.

* **Examples**: Sales trends, quarterly performance, market analysis.

| ----------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Purpose     | Real-time transaction processing | Business intelligence and analytics |
| Data Volume | Low to Medium                    | Large, historical                   |
| Users       | Frontline staff, customers       | Analysts, managers                  |
| Structure   | Highly normalized                | Denormalized (Star/Snowflake)       |
| Query Type  | Short, fast                      | Long, complex                       |

## üè¢ What is a Data Warehouse?

### üîπ Definition

A **Data Warehouse** is a **centralized storage system** that integrates data from different sources and makes it available for **reporting and analysis**.

### üß± Key Features

* **Subject-Oriented**: Focuses on business domains like sales, products, or finance.
* **Integrated**: Combines data from multiple systems in a uniform way.
* **Time-Variant**: Stores data over long periods (e.g., years of sales).
* **Non-Volatile**: Once loaded, data is stable and not updated frequently.

```

### üîç Why Is It Needed?

* To **unify data** from different sources
* To support **fast and complex queries**
* To enable **historical analysis** and **business intelligence**

## üìà Use Cases of a Data Warehouse

### üîπ Reporting

* Daily, weekly, monthly reports on business metrics.
* Example: ‚ÄúTop 10 products sold last month.‚Äù

### üîπ Dashboards

* Interactive, visual summaries of key performance indicators.
* Example: A live sales dashboard for regional managers.

### üîπ Analytics

* Deep, statistical analysis to find trends or make predictions.
* Example: Forecasting future demand for a product.

### üîç Why These Are Needed?

* Improve **decision-making** with accurate and timely data
* Detect **trends and patterns** for long-term planning
* Provide **self-service tools** for analysts and non-technical users

## üîÅ ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Process

### üîπ What is ETL?

ETL is the process used to move and prepare data from various sources into a data warehouse.

1. **Extract**: Pull raw data from source systems (databases, APIs, files).
2. **Transform**: Clean, filter, and format the data.
3. **Load**: Push the transformed data into the data warehouse.

```

### üîç Why Is ETL Needed?

* To **clean and unify** data from diverse sources
* To **apply business logic** and data rules
* To make data **analysis-ready** for reporting and decision-making
